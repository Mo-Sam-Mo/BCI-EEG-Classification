## Setup & Installation
Ensure you have Python installed along with the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scipy scikit-learn mne
```

## Data Loading
The project supports EEG datasets compatible with MNE-Python. Ensure your dataset is properly formatted before loading.

## Core Functions
- **Feature Extraction:** Using Common Spatial Patterns (CSP).
- **Preprocessing:** Signal filtering and artifact removal.
- **Classification:** Machine learning models such as SVM, LDA, and Random Forest.

## Signal Visualization
EEG signals can be visualized using MNE and Matplotlib for better understanding and debugging.

## Data Preprocessing
Includes filtering, artifact removal, and normalization for improved model performance.

## Model Training & Evaluation
Trains various machine learning models and evaluates performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Results
Performance evaluation of different models with visualizations.
